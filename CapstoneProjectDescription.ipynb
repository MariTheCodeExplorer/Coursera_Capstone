For indecisive people  who may end up overly analyzing their choices of where to eat and spending their free time on deciding where to go instead of  using  it more appropriately, recommender system that will do the analysis for them will be time and nerve saviour ."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For data source of location data I will use Foursquare Check-in data for Tallinn city (more in detail the fields and their description can be found here: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/checkins/details) and I will use User-User collaborative filtering algorithms for recommender system."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.8", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
